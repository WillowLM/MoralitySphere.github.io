    <h1>Digital Literacy</h1>
    <p>
        Introduction: To make social media a more positive experience for everyone it's very important to make sure that we actually understand what you are seeing. This might seem like an extremely basic concept but for the majority of people, they can't properly discern misinformation from facts. This is because they are digitally illiterate, they lack the ability to evaluate what they are seeing and to analyze what it means. To foster a new digital world where social media positively impacts us, we need to make sure that digital literacy is a widely used skill. Luckily for us it seems that digital literacy is on the rise as found by a study done by ADII, it found that since 2020, we have gone up 5.7, on their index scoring. <sup><a href="Bibliography.html">2</a></sup>

    <h2>Morality and Ethics:</h2>
    <p>
        A sense of responsibility is crucial to build a better social media, this can be done by promoting digital literacy. By educating people around the ethical impacts of their digital actions we can hopefully cut down on the amount of people acting in ways that negatively affect people online. Digital literacy is so important if you want to change how people think and act online.         
    </p>
    <h2>Logical</h2>
    <p>
        from a logical standpoint digital literacy is they key to having a better online world, this is because people who are aware of what they are actually seeing are far more likely to respond appropriately, instead of seeing some click-baity headline on a sketchy website and reacting in outrage, a digital literate person would be able to deduce that the headline has no value. This is just one example of the myriad of applications that digital literacy has.
