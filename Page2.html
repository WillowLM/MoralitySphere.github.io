    <h1>Cultural Shift</h1>
    <p>
        To change how social media impacts us we have to change how we use and feel about social media. This so-called “Cultural Shift” entails promoting inclusivity, empathy and civility in our digital world. In recent years it feels that the digital landscape has evolved into a grotesque battlefield of hate speech, and other pointless disputes that ultimately are meaningless. To counteract this reality we must have a complete cultural shift regarding social media.
    </p>
    <h2>Morality and Ethics:</h2>
    <p>
        From a moral perspective a cultural shift would require dismantling the echo chambers that have been created in online spaces, this would likely be done through introducing new ideas for people to explore. This would hopefully facilitate constructive dialog about topics that wouldn't have been talked about within an echo chamber. By constructing less judgemental spaces online hopefully we can foster moral beliefs of open-mindedness, and critical thinking and transform social media into a catalyst for positive change in our society.         
    </p>
    <h2>Logical</h2>
    <p>
        By cultivating a digital world that values open mindedness and critical thinking this promotes resilience towards digital misinformation and potentially harmful narratives. We live in an era where digital echo chambers and misinformation run rampant, so equipping users with the tools they require to help them critically analyze what they see online is crucial to ensuring that they have the appropriate knowledge to make the most informed decisions they can.
