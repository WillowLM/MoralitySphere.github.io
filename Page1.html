    <h1>Data Transparency</h1>
    <p>Data transparency seems to be at the forefront of a lot of people's minds when the conversions around social media and large tech companies are brought up and that's completely understandable. Today, we exist in a world where your data is a valuable commodity that many companies would love to have. You have a right to know how companies are utilizing, storing and collecting your data. Furthermore Data transparency helps build trust between companies and their customers and helps users make informed decisions about how they engage with their platform.</p>
    <h1>Morality</h1>
    <p>It seems that recently people have not been putting enough focus on honesty and integrity and this extends too big companies too, they have a moral obligation to be open and honest when it comes to our data, we shouldn't have to wonder what these corporations are using our data for. And if companies are concealing our data they used, this is completely undermining the moral values that we have instilled in us since birth. Whereas if companies are being truthful and honest, they are building trust with their customers and this will result in more positive social media presence in everyone's lives. </p>
