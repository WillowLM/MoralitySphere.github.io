    <h1>Data Transparency</h1>
    <p>
        Data Transparency:
        Data transparency is a pressing concern in this new digital age where the most valuable thing you can give a company is your data, but why is that? Your data is valuable for companies as it allows them to accurately train their algorithms and models to recommend you the best products that youâ€™re most likely to actually purchase.
    </p>

        Accountability:  
        Companies often make world changing decisions based on just data, this obviously has some problems when we don't know where they are getting this data or whose it is. How are we supposed to hold companies accountable when we don't even know why they're making their decisions? We can't. so obviously it's important for companies to be extremely transparent with the data they collect and what they use it for.
